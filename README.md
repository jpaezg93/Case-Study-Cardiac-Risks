###  Identifying Factors Associated with Heart Failure Mortality
This project will explore the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset published on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where we will identify the factors that are most associated with mortality in patients with heart failure.

Repository contains 13 variables, which can be divided into four categories:

#### Demographics

* Age (in years)
* Sex (male or female)

#### Baseline clinical characteristics

* Ejection fraction (percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction)
* High blood pressure (boolean, indicating whether the patient has hypertension)
* Creatinine phosphokinase (level of the CPK enzyme in the blood)
* Diabetes (boolean, indicating whether the patient has diabetes)
* Anaemia (boolean, indicating whether the patient has anaemia)

#### Laboratory findings

* Serum creatinine (level of serum creatinine in the blood)
* Serum sodium (level of serum sodium in the blood)
* Platelets (number of platelets in the blood)
#### Outcomes

* Death (boolean, indicating whether the patient died)
